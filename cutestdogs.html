<p>She likes to be active and has to be able to play outside everyday. So seattle may not be the location for her, given the amount of rain we have. She's not very shy and loves children. She's gentle and very faithful. As long as she gets her daily dose of running, she like spending her evenings in a relaxing warm house in front of the fireplace.</p>
